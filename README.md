# mini-L293D module
* mini-L293D module uses 8 wires to communicate with the arduino nano board
* connect pin IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 to pin 2,3,4,5 on arduino nano
* connect pin EN1, EN2 to pin 9,10 (with analog mode) on arduino nano
* connect pin Vcc, GND to pin 5V and GND; 
* Vcc and GND pins power the arduino nano board if it's not connected to a power supply
* pin VIN and GND on the opposite side of mini-L293D board accept 4.5V-36V

# Block Description
* Use the first block to initialize the module
* Use the second block to setup the dircetion and speed of the motors
* Use the third block to stop the one of two motors

# Release Logs
